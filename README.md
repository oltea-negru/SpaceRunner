This project named Space Runner is a minigame created with JavaFX and it is still developing! 

Here you have a video of me giving you an example of what it looks like. The rules are simple: You press "START" and then pick a spaceship to play using the arrows on your keyboard. The more white stars you catch the more points you will have and when you crash 3 times into the meteors the game ends. My next steps will be to add sound effects, background music, add a score scene and an instructions scene and introduce the possibility to select an enhanced ship in case you level up! 

Thank you for you time and hope you will enjoy it!
